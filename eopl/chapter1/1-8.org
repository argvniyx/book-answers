* Exercise 1.8

In the definition of =remove-first=, if the last line were replaced by =(remove-first s (cdr los))=,
what function would the resulting procedure compute? Give the contract, including the usage statement,
for the revised procedure.

** Answer
The revised procedure would look as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
;; remove-first:
;; Sym x Lisof(Sym) -> Listof(Sym)
;;
;; usage:
;; (remove-first s los) returns a list of all of the symbols in los, in the same order, that
;; come after the first occurrence of s in los. In other words, it removes all the symbols in
;; los up to and including the first occurrence of s.
(define remove-first
  (lambda (s los)
    (if (null? los)
        '()
        (if (eqv? (car los) s)
            (cdr los)
            ;; BEFORE: (cons (car los) (remove-first s (cdr los)))
            (remove-first s (cdr los))))))
#+END_SRC
