* Exercise 1.11

In the last line of =subst-in-s-exp=, the recursion is on =sexp= and
not on a smaller substructure. Why is the recursion guaranteed to halt?

** Answer
This is because the recursion on a smaller substructure is handled
by =subst=, which recurs on both the =car= and =cdr= or a given
=s-list=. In a more general sense, the recursion is guaranteed to halt
because both syntactic categories have productions that have
terminals.
