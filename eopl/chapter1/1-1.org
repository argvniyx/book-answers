* Exercise 1.1

Write inductive definitions of the following sets. Write each definition in all three styles
(top-down, bottom-up, and rules of inference). Using your rules, show the derivation of some
sample elements of each set.

** Exercise 1.1.1
={ 3n + 2 | n ∈ N }=

*** Top-down
A number is part of the set =S= iff either condition is fulfilled:

1. =x = 2=, or
2. =x - 3 ∈ S=

**** Tests
 1. =2 ∈ S= fulfills condition 1.
 2. =5 ∈ S=, because =5 - 3 = 2=, and =2 ∈ S=
 3. =8 ∈ S=, because =8 - 3 = 5=, and =5 ∈ S= (from test 2)

*** Bottom-up
Define =S= to be the smallest set contained in =N= that satisfies the following properties:

1. =2 ∈ S= and
2. if =n ∈ S=, then =n + 3 ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =5 ∈ S=, because =2 ∈ S= and =2 + 3 = 5=
2. =8 ∈ S=, because =5 ∈ S= and =5 + 3 = 8=

*** Rules of inference
#+BEGIN_SRC
             n ∈ S
  -----    ---------
  2 ∈ S    n + 3 ∈ S
#+END_SRC

**** Tests
#+BEGIN_SRC
        2 ∈ S
        -----
2 + 3 = 5 ∈ S
-------------
5 + 3 = 8 ∈ S

** Exercise 1.1.2
={ 2n + 3m + 1 | n, m ∈ N }=

*** Top-down
A natural number =x= is part of =S= iff either of the following is satisfied:

1. =x = 1=, or
2. =x - 2 ∈ S=, or
3. =x - 3 ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =1 ∈ S=, due to condition 1.
2. =3 ∈ S=, since =3 - 2 = 1 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 2.
3. =4 ∈ S=, since =4 - 3 = 1 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 3.
4. =5 ∈ S=, since =5 - 2 = 3 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 2.
5. =7 ∈ S=, since =7 - 3 = 4 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 3.

*** Bottom-up
The set =S= is the smallest set contained in =N= that satisfies the following:

1. =1 ∈ S=, and
2. if =n ∈ S=, then =n + 2 ∈ S=, and
3. if =n ∈ S=, then =n + 3 ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =3 ∈ S=, since =1 + 2 = 3 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 2.
2. =4 ∈ S=, since =1 + 3 = 4 ∈ S=, fulfilling condition 3.

** Exercise 1.1.3
={ (n, 2n + 1) | n ∈ N }=

*** Top-down
A tuple of natural numbers is an element of S iff either of the following is fulfilled:

1. =(x, y) = (0, 1)=, or
2. =(x - 1, y - 2) ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =(0, 1) ∈ S= due to 1.
2. =(1, 3) ∈ S= since =(1 - 1, 3 - 2) = (0, 1) ∈ S=

*** Bottom-up
Define =S= to be the smallest set contained in the set of tuples of natural numbers fulfilling all
of the following conditions:

1. =(0, 1) ∈ S=, and
2. if =(x, y) ∈ S=, then =(x + 1, y + 2) ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =(1, 3) ∈ S=, because =(0 + 1, 1 + 2) = (1, 3) ∈ S=
*** Rules of inference
#+BEGIN_SRC
                 (x, y) ∈ S

** Exercise 1.1.4
={ (n, n²) | n ∈ N}=

*** Top-down

A tuple of natural numbers is an element of =S= iff it fulfills either of the following
conditions:

1. =(x, y) = (0, 0)=, or
2. =(x - 1, y - 2x + 1) ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =(1, 1) ∈ S= because =(1 - 1, 1 - 2 + 1) = (0, 0) ∈ S=
2. =(2, 4) ∈ S= because =(2 - 1, 4 - 4 + 1) = (1, 1) ∈ S=

*** Bottom-up
Define =S= to be the smallest set contained in the set of tuples of natural numbers fulfilling
all of the following:

1. =(0, 0) ∈ S=, and
2. if =(x, y) ∈ S=, then =(x + 1, y + 2x + 1) ∈ S=

**** Tests
1. =(1, 1) ∈ S= because =(0 + 1, 0 + 0 + 1) = (1, 1) ∈ S=
2. =(2, 4) ∈ S= because =(1 + 1, 1 + 2 + 1) = (2, 4) ∈ S=
