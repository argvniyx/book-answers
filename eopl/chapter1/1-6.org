* Exercise 1.6

If we reversed the order of the tests in =nth-element=, what would go wrong?

** Answer
The resulting program would look as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define nth-element
  (lambda (lst n)
    (if (zero? n)
        (car lst)
        (if (null? lst)
            (report-list-too-short n)
            (nth-element (cdr lst) (- n 1))))))
#+END_SRC

The problem is that =lst= could be empty and thus the call to =car= would produce an error.
This is a problem because said error would be more uninformative than that reported by
=report-list-too-short=.
