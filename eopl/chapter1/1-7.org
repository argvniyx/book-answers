* Exercise 1.7

The error message from =nth-element= is uninformative. Rewrite =nth-element= so that it produces
a more informative error message, such as =(a b c) does not have 8 elements=.

** Answer
#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(require eopl)
(define nth-element
  (lambda (lst n)

    ;; Helper function
    (define iter
      (lambda (lst n)
        (if (zero? n)
            (car lst)
            (iter (cdr lst) (- n 1)))))

    ;; Error reporting
    ;; an additional test should be added to ensure n ∈ N (i.e. n ≥ 0)
    (if (< n (length lst))
        (iter lst n)
        (report-list-too-short lst n))))

(define report-list-too-short
  (lambda (lst n)
    (eopl:error 'nth-element
                "The list ~s does not have ~s elements.~%" lst (+ n 1))))
