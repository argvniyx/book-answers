* Exercise 1.12

Eliminate the one call to =subst-in-s-exp= in =subst= by replacing it
by its definition and simplifying the resulting procedure. The result
will be a version of =subst= that does not need =subst-in-s-exp=. This
technique is called /inlining/, and is used by optimizing compilers.

** COMMENT Answer
The new definition of =subst= would look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define subst
  (lambda (new old slist)
    (if (null? slist)
        '()
        (cons
         (if (symbol? (car slist))
             (if (eqv? (car slist) old) new (car slist))
             (subst new old (car slist)))
         (subst new old (cdr slist))))))
#+END_SRC
