* Exercise 1.9

Define =remove=, which is like =remove-first=, except that it removes /all/ occurrences of a
given symbol from a list of symbols, not just the first.

** COMMENT Answer
=remove= would look something like this: (renamed to =my-remove= to avoid conflicts with
Racket's existing =remove= function)

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
(define my-remove
  (lambda (s los)
    (if (null? los)
        '()
        (if (eqv? (car los) s)
            (my-remove s (cdr los))
            (cons (car los) (my-remove s (cdr los)))))))
#+END_SRC
