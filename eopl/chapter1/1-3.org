* Exercise 1.3
Find a set =T= of natural numbers such that =0 ∈ T=, and whenever =n ∈ T=, then =n + 3 ∈ T=
but =T ≠ S=, where =S= is the set defined in definition 1.1.2.

** Answer
Any set that adds another axiom is suitable, because =S= is the /smallest/ subset of =N= fulfilling
the definition in 1.1.2.
